```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500">
</div>
```
In this corrected example, we've removed any extra or conflicting classes from the element. This ensures that only the gradient classes are applied, resulting in correct rendering.  Debugging this requires carefully checking the browser's developer tools to see if any other CSS rules are overriding or conflicting with the gradient.  If the issue persists, verify the Tailwind CSS configuration file to ensure that the gradient utilities are correctly loaded and configured.
