# Tailwind CSS Gradient Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in using Tailwind CSS gradients. The problem arises when applying other classes to an element along with a gradient, leading to unpredictable behavior. The gradient may fail to render entirely or display unexpected colors.

## Bug Description

The primary issue stems from conflicts between the gradient classes and other classes applied to the same element. These conflicts can be caused by conflicting utility classes, improperly structured CSS, or a misunderstanding of the Tailwind CSS gradient syntax.

## Solution

The solution lies in carefully reviewing the applied classes and ensuring there are no conflicts or errors in the CSS structure.   Properly structuring the classes, ensuring correct syntax, and double-checking for any conflicting classes will resolve the rendering problem.
